## ⚙️ Setting Up the Database

First time running? No worries! The app will take care of the database setup for you.

### To initialize the database:

1. **Automatic Initialization**: 
   The app will auto-create your database when it runs. But if you're a control freak (like us), you can initialize it manually by running the `init_db()` function in `app.py`.

   ```python
   def init_db():
       with sqlite3.connect(DB_PATH) as conn:
           cursor = conn.cursor()
           cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS skills (
                               id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
                               name TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
                               need INTEGER NOT NULL,
                               have INTEGER NOT NULL)''')
           conn.commit()
   ```

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Application

Now that we’re set up, it’s time to launch this beast and make it yours! 

1. **Run the server**:
   In your terminal, fire up the server with:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Access the app**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/skills`. BOOM, you’re in!

## 📂 Folder Structure

Here’s the rundown of the folder structure so you can see the magic behind the scenes:

| **Folder/File**         | **What’s Inside**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `reversejobboard/`       | The heart of the project.                                                         |
| `app.py`                 | The brains behind the operation (Python code for the app).                        |
| `skills.db`              | Your **personal skill ledger** (SQLite database for storing your data).          |
| `templates/`             | If you need to tweak things, here’s where the HTML templates live (optional).     |
| `static/`                | CSS, JS, all that jazz.                                                           |
| `static/style.css`       | The **style** that makes everything look sharp.                                   |
| `static/script.js`       | JavaScript that powers the **dynamic interactions** (e.g., updating counters).    |
| `README.md`              | This **awesome documentation**.                                                   |
| `requirements.txt`       | All the **Python packages** you need to run the app.                              |
